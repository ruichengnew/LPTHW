print		put out sth on the screen， I think it is a function
()		  parenthesis, when you want do write sth(arguments, strings, etc) which is not a command, you should use these to cover them
""		  double-quotes, if they are strings, you should these
''		  single-quotes, totally same as 双引号
#		    symbol # ， after #, that's your comment, the Python will ignore them, and will help you to read your code better.
1,2,3,4	numbers， you can do math with them
,		    comma, two or more strings, or arguments, etc, you can use , to separate them
+ - * /	operations, do math
=		    equal, which you can name some variable
variable/you can use them to replace a string or a number or sth, so that you can easily to control your code
_		    underscore character, when you name a variable, you can use it, a variable can only contains letters, numbers, and underscore character
{}		  brace,it is kind of format, when you meet it, that means there is a variable
string	word, phrase or a sentence, for now, I think anything you wanna print out is a string
format	it's a special use, you can make a formatter, which is the coolest in my opnion, and do a really beautiful format. In another saying, it can make some code easier, such as reduce some repetition. What's more, we have two ways to use it, f-strings and .format().
end = ''/a good way to make your "print out" in the same line
""" """	/triple-quotes,which can lead a more-lines string
\n		  linefeed
\		    back-slash, escape sequences, some special use(function)
\b		  backspace
\f		  formfeed
\n 		  linefeed
\r		  return
\t		  TAB
\v		  vertical tab [all these are in page 65]
input		if you want to get some information from users, you can use this fucntion

argv 		argument variable, holds the arguments you pass to you Python script when you run it
module	argon, script with features, library
open		function, which can open a file, you can use pydoc to know more details
read		function, read a file
write		function, write sth into a file
def 		define, you can make a new function with def
:       colon, which can tell Python you are going to create a new "block" of code
\t(four spaces) this will tell Python what lines of code are in the block
