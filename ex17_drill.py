#Question 1
from sys import argv
script, from_file, to_file = argv
open(to_file, 'w').write(open(from_file).read())
#I think this is the "one line long" script

#Question 3
#Old command, I will learn Command line crash course later carefully later.

#Question 4
#Sorry, I delete the last two lines and run the script, everything is alright.
#So I can't find the reason.
#But I guess, if I don't close them, the PowerShell will always remember I opened a file, and take bits of CPU, maybe.
